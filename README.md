# MCSErVerse
 A mod for Minecraft 1.19.2 - Fabric. The point is to create a mod that creates a somewhat of a concept of a local metaverse in Minecraft by connecting public and online servers in a generated single player savefile. Then the player can join the singleplayer world in a VR 3rd party mod at their liking and join any server that already exists or custom builds it and then connect to it.
